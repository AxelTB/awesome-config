This is my Awesome configuration. It add many features to Awesome like:
-better sceen management

TODO:
-make the screen widget rules module
-add a bettery module
-complete the process manager, it's currently not updating and the kill button does not work (not written, but the pid and all is ready)
-port to awesome 3.4.*

BUGS:
-May crash
-Need some files in /tmp or will not work, see the Script folder for that or ask question at elv1313 at gmail for information about what script is used for a specific file, it is currently not documented
-The menu y position is wrong
-The desktop disks list does not update as it should
   -Even more broken now
-Titlebar not destroyed when client die
